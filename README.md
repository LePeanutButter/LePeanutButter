### About Me:
My journey into programming started during high school, when I needed to choose a project for a class. I noticed that the virtual assistant on my mother's company's website was poorly implemented, and I decided to fix it as my project. This experience sparked my passion for programming and problem-solving. Since then, I've continued to grow both in my technical skills and in my ability to work collaboratively within teams.

In addition to my love for video games, digital art, fantasy movies and music, I am known for my commitment to delivering high-quality work on time. I excel at organizing teams, delegating tasks, and fostering collaboration through regular progress discussions. I take pride in helping teams achieve their best results while maintaining a strong focus on deadlines and quality.
